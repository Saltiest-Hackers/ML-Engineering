To give credit where credit is due, though, IPython definitely did not originate the &quot;notebook&quot; concept, and in fact didn&#x27;t even support it at first; Wolfram might be right that Mathematica in 1988 is the origin of the UI paradigm.  Jupyter is where it&#x27;s at, though — you can use Sympy for symbolic computations, Numpy and Scipy for numerical computation (including stuff big enough you have to farm it out to a cluster), TensorFlow for artificial neural networks, and LaTeX for equations in your expository text, thanks to the amazing MathJax.  You can use non-Python languages in Jupyter, either in particular cells — some of my notebooks have %%bash cells for things that are most easily done in bash — or for the whole notebook, R being a particularly appealing language for this.  (SageMath also supports a notebook interface, I think, but I haven&#x27;t tried it.)<p>Bret Victor&#x27;s work in the 2000s has explored a lot of different ways to create and share such simulations; his talk &quot;Inventing on Principle&quot; is a mind-opening collection of demos on the subject.<p>Mike Bostock wrote d3, one of the best tools for building such &quot;explorable explanations&quot;, and put together <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bl.ocks.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bl.ocks.org&#x2F;</a> as a way of sharing them.<p>Nicky Case came up with the term &quot;explorable explanations&quot; and has written a lot of the best examples of the genre; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;explorabl.es&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;explorabl.es&#x2F;</a> is their site for this.<p>Amit Patel has also written a number of really excellent explorable explanations (using the term &quot;interactive illustrations&quot;), largely about writing games, at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;redblobgames.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;redblobgames.com&#x2F;</a>.<p>A really enormous problem with the whole field is reproducibility, dependencies, and archival; if you do an SVD in Numpy, for example, you&#x27;re invoking the SVD code in LAPACK, so the results you get depend on the particular Fortran compiler you compiled Numpy with.  Someone attempting to reproduce your results in 2030, 2050, or 2119 is likely to get different results.  This is fine for presenting finished results, but it is a huge problem for extending them further.  Kay, again, has done some of the key work in this area with his paper with Nguyen on archival virtual machines (a much better followup to Lorie&#x27;s flawed UVC work; the bootstrappable crowd (mescc, stage0, and the like) are making major progress on making the bottom layer of the stack reproducible; and Nix and Guix are solving the problem of reproducible software configurations.',\n",

       "  'There&#x27;s a reasonable related article here [1]. It discusses two different studies on the effects of Seattle&#x27;s minimum wage increases. The first is from Berkeley and based on limited data. It suggested there was mostly just a small reduction in employment with an overall positive effect. The other study was from the University of Washington and had access to detailed low level data on hours worked, salaries, etc. It found numerous very negative affects, many of which were worse than even minimum wage critics generally suggest might occur. This included an overall gross decline in overall wages due to declines in hours being worked - overall wages rose 3% while the number of hours worked declined 9%.<p>The reason I mention the Berkeley study at all is because this now led to arguments based on after-the-fact retrofitting. In particular increase supporters have now tried to argue that Seattle was in a unique boom phase and so the study was comparing against a local max, and thus there was actually no damage - but just Seattle &#x27;regressing to the mean&#x27; if you will. But the Washington study also considered this possibility and contrasted it against other control cities within Washington that did not increase wages, and found that they did not experience the negative effects. And so on back and forth it goes.<p>And so who do you believe? Probably whoever you want to be right. This is why I&#x27;d suggest laying out metrics beforehand. If Seattle was in a unique boom phase before the minimum wage increases then this is something everybody could agree on beforehand. When you do after-the-fact analysis, you risk peoples biases getting in the way of things. And because of the complexity of systems such as these, it&#x27;s always going to be pretty easy to prove <i>X</i> and also prove <i>not X</i> after the fact.<p>[1] - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;06&#x2F;26&#x2F;business&#x2F;economy&#x2F;seattle-minimum-wage.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;06&#x2F;26&#x2F;business&#x2F;economy&#x2F;seattle-...</a>',\n",

You also have to rely on two sets of developers to ensure you can stay up-to-date, and this introduces more potential for errors and bugs.<p>Furthermore, the static type systems supported by, e.g., MyPy do not perfectly reflect the dynamic semantics of the Python language. So what you really have is some subset of Python that you&#x27;re allowed to use fully. (This is probably not a big issue for many people, to be fair.)<p>Another problem is that systems like MyPy require you to actually write the type hints in a lot of places. Manifest type systems are not favored because requiring users to write more is almost never something they&#x27;re happy with. One of the most common complaints about Java is that you have to write so many types everywhere, and while you don&#x27;t need <i>that</i> many in statically typing your Python code, you do need quite a few. A statically typed language with good type inference definitely wins here.<p>Type hints are also not very expressive because they&#x27;re purely nominal, but Python&#x27;s type system is actually structural (which is true for most dynamically typed languages, as far as I know). I haven&#x27;t experimented with this too much because I don&#x27;t use a type checker like MyPy, but I seem to remember that it treated types nominally. (I think I&#x27;ve also seen some indication that they&#x27;re working to extend type hints to support structural types, but last I checked it wasn&#x27;t right around the corner or anything.)<p>What I&#x27;m getting at here is that while external type checkers like MyPy can be considered an improvement over the dynamically typed language itself, they come with a lot of caveats that make me uncomfortable. There are few cases where I truly <i>prefer</i> dynamic types to static ones.',\n",

So I picked up a used algebra textbook and read through it and worked some examples until I understood it.
